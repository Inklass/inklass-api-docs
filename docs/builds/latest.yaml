    Welcome to the Inklass API documentation.

    **Base API URL:** https://api.inklass.com.au

    **Current Documentation Scope:** Our documentation is continuously evolving. While we have made significant strides in detailing our APIs, several endpoints are still undergoing further development and documentation.

    **Authentication:** Access to the Inklass API endpoints is secured through bearer authentication. To access the API, you must use an access token generated via the Inklass web dashboard. Two types of access tokens are available:
    - App Token: Generated for an `API Application` with specific permissions; this can be whitelisted by ip.
    - User Token: Generated for a standard user with personalised access rights (use only for testing).

    Both tokens are bound to explicit scopes that define the API functionality accessible to the token. Additionally, tokens are associated with a list of organisations that they are authorized to administer. Consequently, all API requests are strictly constrained within the boundaries of these predefined scopes and organisational permissions to ensure security and data integrity.

    We recommend all partners and customers review the authentication guidelines to understand the scope and limitations of their access tokens and to ensure compliant interaction with our APIs.

    For any assistance or further information, please reach out to our support team.

      summary: Send Notification
      description: |
        Send push and/or in-app notifications to a specified audience. Push notifications are immediate and appear on device screens. In-app notifications are saved and displayed within the app interface. 


        Both are real-time either by a push service or websockets. It may be best to use both at the same time so the user has something to refer back to. 

        In-app notifications are assigned an internal identifier to track if they have been marked as read by the user. 
        Internally, notifications are targeted by device, even if audienced via user as the audience is resolved at the time of sending.
        Devices are grouped by an Inklass userId, each Inklass user is linked to platform-specific users. When a notification is marked as read by a device,
        devices with the same userId will also mark that notification as read in real-time. An undocumented API is available for fetching notification recipients with their read/send status.

        Note that your audience reach is strictly limited by your access token scopes and (organisationsIds or organisationsUUIDs).

        A JWT generated for a particular app or user.

        This token allows the bearer to perform requests within the context of the
        app/user for whom the token was generated. The JWT tokens have different scopes
        to limit what endpoints can be used; it is recommended that only the strictly required 
        scopes are allocated to an API app or user.

          description: Unique identifier to mark a notification as sent. Prevents duplicate sending. Inklass will cancel the internal send request and return with a warning letting the client know that it has already attempted to send this notification. Keep null if not required as to improve efficiency. Internally, this will be combined with the provider declared in the context.
          example: notif-12345
        markAsSentIdExpiryDays:

          nullable: true
          description: The lifespan, in days, of the 'sent' mark before it expires and allows resending. This is required if the markAsSentId has been provided. This should typically never exceed 14 days before garbadge collection.

This essentially works as a mechanism to update already sent push and in-app notifications with more relevant information. Example, if keeping track of a fixture status, the user looking at the notification half-an-hour later should only see a single notification with the most recent update. Just note that this is not supported in all contexts.
          example: activity-3224-status

Can be "schoolbox-profile" for Schoolbox managed portrait images, "generic-url" for direct URL links, or "schoolbox-image-file-hash" for file-based fetch images with a unique hash. If this is set to "schoolbox-profile", Inklass may automatically retrieve any custom asociated images and populate the file hash.
