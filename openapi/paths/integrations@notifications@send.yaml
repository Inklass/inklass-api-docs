  description: |
    Send push and/or in-app notifications to a specified audience. Push notifications are immediate and appear on device screens. In-app notifications are saved and displayed within the app interface. 
    
    
    Both are real-time either by a push service or websockets. It may be best to use both at the same time so the user has something to refer back to. 
    
    In-app notifications are assigned an internal identifier to track if they have been marked as read by the user. 
    Internally, notifications are targeted by device, even if audienced via user as the audience is resolved at the time of sending.
    Devices are grouped by an Inklass userId, each Inklass user is linked to platform-specific users. When a notification is marked as read by a device,
    devices with the same userId will also mark that notification as read in real-time. An undocumented API is available for fetching notification recipients with their read/send status.
    
    Note that your audience reach is strictly limited by your access token scopes and (organisationsIds or organisationsUUIDs).
